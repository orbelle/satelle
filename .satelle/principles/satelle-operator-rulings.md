# Operator rulings (satelle v1)

Recorded 2026-11-06. These hold until the operator changes them; a change is
itself reviewed (see *Directives are reviewed*).

- **Process lives in configuration, never in Go.** The binary is a stateless,
  generic kernel: items, workflows, gates as skills, agents with grants, a
  hash-chained ledger. A plan or diff that puts a step, state, skill, category
  or tag decision into Go is rejected, with no exemption (binary-scope gate,
  first and fail-fast).
- **Quality over speed.** A useful reviewer beats a cheap one, within limits.
  Reviewer cycles and their results are the main quality signal and can also be
  the main blocker: record them, compare judges, and change a judge on evidence.
- **Attachments are the record.** Plans, notes and evidence live as attachments
  in the item's ledger. Agents read them from the item when they need them; they
  sync to satelle-server and travel to remotes with the item.
- **Directives are reviewed.** The operator's own directives that change
  process, configuration, scope or a ruling are judged against these rulings and
  the constitution; push back with reasons where they conflict. Questions and
  status checks are not.
- **Local first.** satelle runs solo and local; team-of-one and team (with
  satelle.dev) are modes on top. Every satelle ↔ satelle-server call is gRPC.
- **Breaking changes are pushed; old versions are defunct.** v1 is a clean
  rewrite, in satelle and satelle-server alike: no backward compatibility in the
  wire (no REST beside gRPC), storage or configuration. The users are the
  operator and a few testers; satelle provides the way across (`satelle
  upgrade`), client and server ship together, and the previous install is
  backed up before a swap.
- **Dogfood.** satelle is built with satelle: every change is a story driven
  through this repo's workflow on the rebuild branch, released locally, then
  used.
- **Order is a tag.** A container's children carry `order:N`; the operator or
  an agent resuming takes the lowest open one unless told otherwise.
- **Never work around a block.** A gate, hook or fence that refuses is either
  right or a gap; raise a story for the gap and record any manual step taken.
